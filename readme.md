**This simple Dice game allows two playes to keep rolling the dice until a player gets a total of 20 points and is declared the winner.**


**#CodeSteps**

1. Create variables for the game state
1. Create variables to store references to the necessary DOM nodes
1. Hook up a click event listener to the Roll Dice Button. Log out a random number between 1 and 6. 
    > Hint: use Math.floor() and Math.random()
1. Find out which players turn it is
1. log out the value e.g. **"Player 1 rolled 5"**
1. Switch the turn back to the other player
1. Display the dice number instead of logging it out
1. Use the 'active' class to show which player's turn it is 
    > Hint: use the .classList.remove() and classlist.add() methods*
1. Update the "message" DOM node so that it states who's turn it is
1. Update the scores for each player
1. Display the scores in their scoreboards
